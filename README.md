# Signing the agreements 

You must sign the 3 agreement documents in  https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-CVE-Mentor-Registry/tree/master/agreements with the gpg key you will be using to sign CVE ID assignments. Simply use gpg:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-CVE-Mentor-Registry/master/agreements/CVE-CNA-Rules.txt
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-CVE-Mentor-Registry/master/agreements/CVE-Terms-of-Use.txt
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-CVE-Mentor-Registry/master/agreements/DWF-Contributor-Agreement.txt

gpg --clearsign CVE-CNA-Rules.txt
gpg --clearsign CVE-Terms-of-Use.txt
gpg --clearsign DWF-Contributor-Agreement.txt
```

And then attach and send the 3 .asc files to the DWF so we can embed them in your mentor record.
