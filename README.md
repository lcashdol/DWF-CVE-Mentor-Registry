# DWF-CVE-Mentor-Registry

Becoming a CVE Mentor is simple:

1. Find a mentor to sponsor you (check the existing registry, if you can't find one contact kurt@seifried.org)
2. Fill out the CVE Mentor template (name, email addresses, GPG key, etc.) available at https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-CVE-Mentor-Registry/blob/master/mentors/cve-mentor-json-template-v1.json
3. Email it to kurt@seifried.org, please indicate in your email if you want to also become a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA), this is not required (e.g. some CVE Mentors will work with existing CNAs, or specialize in training and other related activities)

## Signing the agreements 

You must sign the 3 agreement documents in  https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-CVE-Mentor-Registry/tree/master/agreements with the gpg key you will be using to sign CVE ID assignments. Simply use gpg:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-CVE-Mentor-Registry/master/agreements/CVE-CNA-Rules.txt
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-CVE-Mentor-Registry/master/agreements/CVE-Terms-of-Use.txt
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-CVE-Mentor-Registry/master/agreements/DWF-Contributor-Agreement.txt

gpg --clearsign CVE-CNA-Rules.txt
gpg --clearsign CVE-Terms-of-Use.txt
gpg --clearsign DWF-Contributor-Agreement.txt
```

And then attach and send the 3 .asc files to the DWF along with your template so we can embed them in your mentor record.
