# DWF-CVE-Mentor-Registry

# Signing the agreements 

You must sign the 3 agreement documents in  https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-CVE-Mentor-Registry/tree/master/agreements with the gpg key you will be using to sign CVE ID assignments. Simply use gpg:

```
gpg --clearsign filename
```

And then attach and send the 3 .asc files to the DWF so we can embed them in your mentor record.
